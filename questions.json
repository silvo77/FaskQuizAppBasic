        "explanation": " Reserved Instances (RIs) are a pricing model that allows you to reserve EC2 instances for a specified period of time (one or three years) and receive a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing. RIs are suitable for workloads that have predictable usage patterns and require a long-term commitment. You can choose between three payment options: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront. The more you pay upfront, the greater the discount1. Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your EC2 costs by up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one or three year term. Savings Plans apply to usage across EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. You can choose between two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans offer the most flexibility and apply to any instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or region. EC2 Instance Savings Plans offer the highest discount and apply to a specific instance family within a region2. Spot Instances are a pricing model that allows you to bid for unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud and are available at a discount of up to 90% compared to On- Demand pricing. Spot Instances are suitable for fault-tolerant or stateless workloads that can run on heterogeneous hardware and have flexible start and end times. However, Spot Instances are not guaranteed and can be interrupted by AWS at any time if the demand for capacity increases or your bid price is lower than the current Spot price3. On-Demand Instances are a pricing model that allows you to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments. On-Demand Instances are suitable for short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted, or for applications that are being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time. However, On-Demand Instances are the most expensive option among the four pricing models4. Dedicated Hosts are physical EC2 servers fully dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server- bound software licenses, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Dedicated Hosts can be purchased On-Demand or as part of Savings Plans. Dedicated Hosts are suitable for workloads that need to run on dedicated physical servers or have strict licensing requirements. However, Dedicated Hosts are not the lowest cost option among the four pricing models."

VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region. Traffic between peered VPCs never traverses the public internet. VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships, which means that if VPC A is peered with VPC B, and VPC B is peered with VPC C, then VPC A and VPC C are not automatically peered789. AWS Transit Gateway is a networking service that acts as a regional router for your VPCs and on- premises networks. You can attach up to 5,000 VPCs and VPN connections to a single transit gateway and route traffic between them.

Agility helps businesses to respond to changing customer demands, market opportunities, and competitive threats, and to innovate faster and cheaper. Agility also reduces the risk of failure, as businesses can test and validate their assumptions before committing to large-scale deployments. Some of the benefits of agility in AWS Cloud computing are: ? The speed at which AWS resources are implemented: AWS provides a variety of services and tools that allow you to create, configure, and launch AWS resources in minutes, using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Software Development Kits (AWS SDKs), or the AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to define your AWS resources as code using familiar programming languages, and synthesize them into AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Service Catalog to create and manage standardized portfolios of AWS resources that meet your organizational policies and best practices. AWS also offers on-demand, pay-as-you-go pricing models, so you only pay for the resources you use, and you can scale them up or down as your needs change12345 ? The ability to experiment quickly: AWS enables you to experiment quickly with new ideas and solutions, without having to invest in upfront capital or long-term commitments. You can use AWS to create and test multiple prototypes, hypotheses, and minimum viable products (MVPs) in parallel, and measure their performance and feedback. You can also use AWS to leverage existing services and solutions, such as AWS Marketplace, AWS Solutions, and AWS Quick Starts, that can help you accelerate your innovation process. AWS also supports a culture of experimentation and learning, by providing tools and resources for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), testing, monitoring, and analytics.

Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. AWS Artifact can help you demonstrate compliance with credit card regulatory requirements by providing you with proof that the AWS services and deployment are in compliance. Getting the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor is an action that the company should take to ensure that the application meets the specific requirements of the credit card industry. A company assessor is an independent third-party entity that is qualified to assess the compliance of the application with the relevant standards and regulations. Using Amazon Inspector to submit the application for certification is not an action that the company should take, because Amazon Inspector is a service that helps you improve the security and compliance of your applications deployed on AWS by automatically assessing them for vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices, but it does not provide certification for the applications. Ensuring that the application’s underlying hardware components comply with requirements is not an action that the company should take, because the application is deployed on AWS, and AWS is responsible for the security and compliance of the underlying hardware components. This is part of the shared responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud. Using AWS Security Hub to certify the compliance of the application is not an action that the company should take, because AWS Security Hub is a service that gives you a comprehensive view of your security posture across your AWS accounts and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices, but it does not provide certification for the applications."

D is incorrect because Spot Instances are the instance purchasing option that allows customers to bid on spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity, which is more suitable for flexible, scalable, and fault-tolerant workloads that can tolerate interruptions."

        "explanation": " AWS is responsible for decommissioning end-of-life underlying storage devices that are used to host data on AWS. AWS follows strict and audited data destruction processes to ensure that customer data is not exposed to unauthorized individuals or devices when an AWS storage device reaches the end of its useful life. AWS uses techniques detailed in DoD 5220.22-M (“National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual”) or NIST 800-88 (“Guidelines for Media Sanitization”) to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process3."

            "D"
        ],
        "type": "multiple",
        "explanation": " The correct answers are C and D because S3 bucket policies and IAM user policies are AWS features that will meet the requirements. S3 bucket policies are access policies that can be attached to Amazon S3 buckets to grant or deny permissions to the bucket and the objects it contains. S3 bucket policies can be used to control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket. IAM user policies are access policies that can be attached to IAM users to grant or deny permissions to AWS resources and actions. IAM user policies can be used to control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket. The other options are incorrect because they are not AWS features that will meet the requirements. Security groups and network ACLs are AWS features that act as firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from Amazon EC2 instances and subnets. Security groups and network ACLs do not control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket. S3 bucket versioning is an AWS feature that enables users to keep multiple versions of the same object in the same bucket. S3 bucket versioning can be used to recover from accidental overwrites or deletions of objects, but it does not control who has permission to read, write, or delete objects that the company stores in the S3 bucket.

Availability Zones are part of the AWS global infrastructure, which consists of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations. Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an AWS Region that are engineered to be isolated from failures and connected by low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. Each Availability Zone contains one or more data centers that house the servers and storage devices that run AWS services. Availability Zones enable users to design and operate fault-tolerant and high-availability applications on AWS. AWS Global InfrastructureAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - aws.amazon.com"
